This software has a configurable Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network with 
Sigmoid activation & Softmax output functions designed to classify. 

This ANN has a gradient descent back-propagation training algorithm based on 
cross entropy error, with automatic learning rate and momentum adaption.

The main code creates, trains, validates and tests some examples of customized
ANN.
