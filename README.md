This software is a configurable Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
with Sigmoid activation & Softmax output functions. It's designed to performance 
classification tasks, such as classification of heatbeats (that's its main 
application)

The ANN go with a gradient descent back-propagation training algorithm, based on 
cross entropy error and auto-adaptive learning rates and momentums.

The main code creates, trains, validates and tests some examples of customized
ANNs.
